game logic
create a domino shape piece
50% chance just single tile
50% change double tile
numbers to generate:
	lowest number = up to 7 lower than current number [>0]
	higher number = up to 4 lower than current number [>0]
combination logic:
	when 3+ adjacent = combine them on the most recent tile
		do recursively if there are combinations
	points are equal to the tiles combined
		ex: when 1, 1, 1 turned into 2, give 3 points
		if combo'd -> give 2x/3x/etc points


ui logic
click tile to rotate clockwise
drag tile around to move it to a respective tile 
	when dragging, scrollwheel to rotate counter/clockwise
when hovering over a tile, 'highlight' it so that way it's clear where it'll snap too if it drops
	if invalid tile/drop position, highlight red
	if valid, highlight blue
